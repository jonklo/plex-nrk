 Plex plugin for NRK
#####################

A Plex plugin for Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK). 

Author: Jon Lonne <jonklo at gmail dot com>

Provides an easy to use interface for NRK's content. Currently includes 
live tv, web tv, live radio and audio/video podcasts.

Installation
============
If installing manually, place the bundle in the Plex plugin folder: 
    ~/Library/Application Support/Plex Media Server/Plug-ins

Automatic installers are available on GitHub:
    http://github.com/jonklo/plex-nrk/downloads

After installation, the plugin is available under the `Videos` section in 
Plex.

Known issues
============
- It takes way to long to navigate the menues, mainly because of resolving 
  the video stream links.
- The live tv streams changes often, and are sure to be broken at some point.
